              <p>
                Replacing disparate HR, payroll, and workforce management processes with one unified, cloud-based system.
              </p>
              <h4>My Contribution</h4>
              <p>As a consultant on this project, I played a pivotal role in facilitating the integration of UKG into 
                Lettuce Entertain You Restaurants' (LEY) operational framework. Months after leaving to pursue my education, 
                I was approached by LEY to lend my expertise in navigating the transition.
                <br><br>
                My responsibilities spanned multiple areas. I actively participated in meetings with the vendor and primary stakeholders,
                bridging the gap between business requirements and technical configurations. I also spearheaded the creation of user accounts

                Seeking a new solution for workforce management, recruitment, and onboarding.
              </p>
              <h4>My Contribution</h4>
              <p>In response to complex new labor compliance legislation, LEY was in need of a system with improved configuration 
                flexibility. Having become established as LEY's workforce management subject matter expert, I was a primary contributor 
                to the configuration and implementation of Harri's HCM solution.
                <br><br>
                During the course of this task, I worked one-on-one with Harri's project leader to configure the system to fulfill 
                functional requirements while incorporating new features and processes to meet compliance standards and expand user capabilities. I helped
                integrate Harri with existing applications, implemented custom reports, and became a system admin for 
                Sophos MDM to manage newly deployed hardware. I provided training and documentation to end users and was the first point of contact during

              <p>
                Replacing an archaic, fragmented system with a centralized entity.
              </p>
              <h4>My Contribution</h4>
              <p>The applications team at LEY was tasked with replacing a decentralized time and attendance system which was beyond end of life. 
                Initially brought in to provide networking, hardware, and desktop support, my role evolved significantly throughout the project lifecycle.

                to accommodate the new system seamlessly. 
                <br><br>
                As I delved deeper into the Kronos application, my responsibilities expanded to encompass end-user 
                training and documentation. Gradually, I transitioned to becoming the primary support resource for the application, eventually joining the 
                applications team full-time. In this capacity, I took charge of change management processes, provided assistance to payroll functions, 
                and implemented new features to enhance the end-user experience.

              <p>For my final project at WGU, I developed an application utilizing machine learning to address a fictional business problem. 
                Choosing Python and Scikit-learn libraries, I constructed a logistic regression model within the application. Its purpose was to 
                analyze therapy session transcripts for indications of suicidality with the goal of optimizing processes by automating aspects of 
                patient classification.
                <br><br>
                The application featured a user-friendly graphical interface, 
                allowing users to input and analyze phrases, text files, or batches of files. The machine learning model, trained on publicly available 
                data, generated responsive visualizations showcasing classification distributions and model performance.
                <br><br>
                Beyond the application, the project entailed comprehensive documentation, including a letter of transmittal, project proposal plan, 
                and post-implementation report. This project served as a culmination of my studies at WGU, showcasing my proficiency in coding, 
                UI design, and technical writing.

              <h3>Data Structures and Algorithms</h3>
              <p>
                Solving a 21st century version of the traveling salesman problem.
              </p>
              <h4>Project Overview</h4>
              <p> As part of my coursework in Data Structures and Algorithms, I undertook a modern interpretation of the classic traveling salesman problem. 
                The project tasked me with devising an efficient solution for delivering packages to multiple addresses using multiple drivers and vehicles.
                <br><br>
                Harnessing Python, I constructed a bespoke hash table to manage package data from the ground up. Employing the nearest neighbor algorithm, 
                I crafted optimized delivery routes that fulfilled all assignment specifications. Beyond the coding, I was required to evaluate each script 
                component for its time and space complexity, showcasing my competency in coding efficiency. Additionally, I composed a comprehensive write-up 
                detailing the rationale behind my decisions, demonstrating both technical acumen and strategic thinking.
                <br><br>
                This project not only honed my skills in data structures and algorithms but also underscored my ability to tackle complex real-world 
                challenges with innovative solutions.

              <p>
                A GUI-based desktop application to manage appointments.
              </p>
              <h4>Project Overview</h4>
              <p> For a project in GUI-based application development, I created an application tailored to the specific needs of a fictional 
                company. Coded in Java and SQL, the application incorporated various functionalities and utilized JavaFX for graphical elements and MySQL JDBC for database connections.

                The project entailed the creation of a log-in form with advanced capabilities, including user location detection, language-based 
                translation, and error message handling. Additionally, I implemented functionalities for managing customer records and appointments, 
                incorporating features such as auto-generation of IDs, dynamic data collection, and robust input validation.
                The application also included scheduling functionalities, allowing users to add, update, and delete appointments with ease. 
                Reporting capabilities which enabled users to generate reports on customer appointments, contact schedules, and custom datasets were also included.
                <br><br>
                To enhance code efficiency and readability, I incorporated lambda expressions within the application. Moreover, I 
                implemented user activity tracking functionality, recording login attempts, timestamps, and success statuses in a designated file. 
                In adherence to best practices, I extensively documented the codebase with descriptive Javadoc comments, ensuring clarity and 
                comprehensiveness. Additionally, I created a detailed README.txt file providing essential information about the application, 
                including setup instructions, additional report descriptions, and software version details.
                <br><br>
                This project not only demonstrated my proficiency in GUI-based application development but also showcased my ability to adhere to 
                strict requirements, implement advanced functionalities, and maintain code quality through thorough documentation and 
                adherence to best practices.

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="about__content">
          <div class="about__text">
            <p>
              With a decade-long journey navigating the realms of customer service, IT support, and software implementation, 
              I bring a wealth of diverse experiences and a passion for technology-driven solutions.
              <br><br>
              My journey began in November 2010 when, with no clear professional aspirations, I joined Lettuce Entertain 
              You (LEY) as a cashier in Chicago. Recognized for my dedication and reliability, I was given keys to the store 
              and promoted to Shift Supervisor within less than a year. With a desire to go beyond restaurant operations, 
              and driven by a passion for technology, I seized an opportunity in April 2013 to embark on a new path within 
              LEY's IT department through their corporate internship program. This step marked the genesis of my professional 
              evolution towards a career in technology.
              <br><br>
              In July 2013, I accepted an offer for a full-time position as a help desk technician, leveraging my 
              problem-solving skills to provide timely resolutions and support to end-users. As my expertise expanded, I 
              ventured into the realm of software implementation, collaborating with the Applications Team to ensure seamless 
              transitions and optimal utilization of new technologies. Recognizing my aptitude and dedication, I was promoted 
              to the role of Applications Support Analyst in June 2015, solidifying my commitment to enhancing operational 
              efficiencies and user experiences through technology.
              <br><br>
              My journey took a geographical shift in December 2015, as I relocated to Philadelphia. Despite the distance, my 
              effectiveness remained unaffected, seamlessly transitioning to remote support while concurrently providing 
              on-site network and hardware support for LEY's east coast locations.
              <br><br>
              In May 2021, fueled by a desire for continuous growth, I made the bold decision to depart from LEY to pursue 
              my education full-time. However, my connection to the company remained strong, leading me to 
              briefly return in January 2022 to lend my expertise to the UKG software implementation project before resuming 
              my academic pursuits. In February 2024, armed with newfound knowledge and skills, I proudly graduated with a 
              Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, ready to embark on the next chapter of my professional journey. Since 
              then, I have been actively pursuing certifications to further enhance my expertise while eagerly seeking 
              opportunities to contribute my talents and insights to innovative teams.
              <br><br>
              With a foundation built on dedication, adaptability, and a relentless pursuit of excellence, I am excited to 
              explore new horizons and make meaningful contributions in the ever-evolving landscape of technology.
